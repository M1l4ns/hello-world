#This turtle code is not exactly the same as the shape, however it is the same concept as the shape provided.
#To begin, I imported a turtle and named it Rob. I next gave Rob an outline colour of Orange and a yellow fill which could be added
in the future to give it more character. I moved Rob Forward 100 pixel and rotated him right 45 degrees, I moved him forward again
followed by 135 degress to get a straight line back towards the start. after it moved I gave it a 45 degree angle to return back to start.
To finish of I moved it right by 69.45 degrees which made sure the diamond shapes between were made.
I used a loop for the turtle to repeat these actions 11 times which drew out the shape.
